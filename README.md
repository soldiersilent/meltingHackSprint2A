# Cards Goetia - A Deck-Building Game About Summoning Demons

## Concept

**Cards Goetia** is a strategic card-based game set in a world of magic and demonic summoning. Inspired by the ancient grimoire *The Lesser Key of Solomon*, players inherit the role of a sorcerer, tasked with mastering powerful spells, summoning demons, and building a formidable deck to battle opponents. Begin your journey in a mysterious house filled with magical artifacts, guided by the voice of your deceased uncle's skull, and progress through single-player and multiplayer modes to become the ultimate sorcerer.

## Story Introduction

You discover that your uncle has passed away, leaving you his enigmatic house. Upon entering, you find a talking skull on the mantelpiece, containing your uncle's voice. He introduces you to the world of sorcery and guides you through your first spells and demon summoning rituals. Your goal is to either help your uncle rest in peace by reuniting his skull with his body or to follow in his footsteps and continue his legacy as a powerful sorcerer.
